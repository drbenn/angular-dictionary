<p class="h3 text-primary"><strong>09</strong> - View Encapsulation</p>
<p>
  CSS Styles, by default, do not go outside the component where the CSS is
  located. However, with decorators @Input and @Output you will transfer the
  data to other components, and you would assume the styles would come along
  with them. They do not.

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Emulated</strong> - The natural state of Angular. CSS Styles only
    apply within its own component
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>None</strong> - If selected, all CSS in this component will become
    global for use in the entire project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Native</strong> - Same result as emulated, but for use with browsers
    that use the ShadowDom technology.
  </li>
</ol>
