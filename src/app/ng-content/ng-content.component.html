<p class="h3 text-primary"><strong>12</strong> - ng-Content</p>
<p>
  Normally, everything you place between the calling of the component will be
  lost &lt;app-something&gt;<span class="text-danger"
    >This is lost by default in Angular</span
  >
  &lt;/app-something&gt;. However, using the directive ng-Content tag it will
  act as a hook to locate
</p>
<p>
  Below, we take the following html from a child component that we would like to
  place in between the calling of the component.
</p>
<img
  class="center-block img-responsive img-thumbnail"
  alt="image alt"
  src="../../assets/img/12A1.JPG"
/>

  Below, we take the following html from a child component, and place it between
  the brackets where it is called, ony changing naming convention of element to
  serverElement because of the ngFor statement
</p>
<img
  class="center-block img-responsive img-thumbnail"
  alt="image alt"
  src="../../assets/img/12A2.JPG"
/>
<br />
<p>
  And going back to the child component html we insert the ng-Content hook to
  show where the content between the calling of the component should run in the
  sub-component.
</p>
<img
  class="center-block img-responsive img-thumbnail"
  alt="image alt"
  src="../../assets/img/12A3.JPG"
/>
