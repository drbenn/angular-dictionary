<p class="h3 text-primary"><strong>10</strong> - Local Reference</p>
<p>
  Instead of two-way binding can place a local reference on an element, which
  can be placed on any HTML element. But reference can only be used in HTML, not
  in TS.
</p>
<p>
  However, below, #serverNameInput is a local reference only in HTML, but it is
  passed to TS event binding through onAddServer().
</p>
<p>
  The HTML below comments out the two way binding method for Server Name an
  dinstead inputs the local reference of #serverNameInput on the form input.
  This reference is then passed through the onAdd functions to the TS via
  (click) event
</p>
<img
  class="center-block img-responsive img-thumbnail"
  alt="image alt"
  src="../../assets/img/10A1.JPG"
/>
<br />
<p>
  Below, in the TS file, instead of being blank, the functions now receive the
  argument of nameInput with HTMLInputElement as the type. Console logging
  nameInput alone will give the full HTMLElement, thus the use of value to get
  the value inputted in the field.
</p>
<p>
  Also, serverName must now be defined by the value of the local reference,
  nameInput.value.
